system: You are an expert scenario designer for a Russian voice assistant's function calling dataset for LLM training.
prompt: |-
    You are given a tool for function calling LLM Agent.
    The target usecase for this agent is to power a Voice Assistant within a smart speaker device.
    Users of this device will chat with the voice assistant (VA) and ask it to perform some helpful tasks for them.
    VA will handle the dialog and if it's possible (given the available tools at runtime) will assist the user by:

    1. Calling a certain tool (or several tools) under-the-hood, sometimes notifying the user on that
    2. Analyzing the tool's response and converting it into a natural speech answer to the user

    Some other notable constraints:
    - VA should be able to decide on its own just from the conversation context which tools are applicable for the current user query if any.
    - It's the VA's responsibility to infer the correct calling params from the natural conversation, ask the user for clarifications if they are needed to perform a correct call.
    - ONLY VA is aware of the call details, stack traces, technical details, log, runtime state, internal monologue, etc.
    - VA don't read aloud any links, unique object identifiers (UID), logs and other technical stuff to the users.
    - The User-VA communication is kept strictly within natural speech as if it would in human-human communication.

    Here is the list of currently supported tools for your reference:
    {{ dumps(tools) }}

    The current tool:
    - Name: "{{ name }}"
    - Description: "{{ description }}"
    - Parameters:
    ```json
    {{ dumps(parameters) }}
    ```

    Task: Generate {{ num_cases }} diverse usage scenarios that cover:
    - Typical use cases
    - Edge cases
    - Multi-hop reasoning scenarios
    - Cases requiring clarification
    - Different user communication styles (formal, casual, unclear)
    - Ensure a mix of simple and complex queries

    Provide each scenario with:
    - Brief context
    - User's potential communication style
    - Specific challenge or interesting aspect of the interaction

    Output format is list of JSON objects like this:
    ```json
    {
        "context": [...]
        "communication": [casual | formal | unclear]
        "interaction": [single-hop | multi-hop]
        "challenges": [...]
    }
    ```
    Here is an example case output for a hypothetical restaurant booking tool:
    ```json
    {
        "context": "User recalls that he wanted to arrange a date with his girlfriend and asks to book a restaurant"
        "communication": "casual"
        "interaction": "multi-hop"
        "challenges": "Need to clearify the time and location because two restaurants with a similar name are returned by the tool"
    }
    ```

    **!!! PLEASE READ BEFORE YOUR ANSWER AND ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING !!!**

    USERS DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE EXACT TOOLS, THEIR IMPLEMENATION DETAILS, ARGUMENTS, THE EVENT IDENTIFIERS (UIDS) OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
    USERS ONLY KNOW SOME OF THE VOICE ASSISTANT'S HIGH-LEVEL CAPABILITIES, LIKE SETTING A TIMER, REMINDING OF SOMETHING, SEARCHING THE INTERNET, ETC.
    ASSUME ONLY NATURAL CLOSE-TO-LIFE SCENARIOS WHERE USERS ARE NOT AWARE OF IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS AND THE FUNCTION CALLING RUNTIME.
    USERS JUST TALK TO THE LLM AGENT (VOICE ASSISTANT) IN TERMS OF TASKS, QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS AS IF IT WAS ANOTHER HUMAN.

    Please respond in {{ language }} language.
